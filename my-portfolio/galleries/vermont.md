<p>In August of 2024, Emily and I drove up to stay a long weekend at a farmhouse located in Hyde Park, Vermont. </p>
<p>This book is a record of our trip.</p>
<h2>
Notes
</h2>
<p>
First casebound photobook. Over time the book has begun to warp and sections have began seperating. This is likely a dual result of loose stitching and I think the cover board's grain direction was not considered. Future casebound books should have tight stitching and stitch with tapes to prevent sections seperation.
